SorkinFam:Thank you for raising me, encouraging me my entire life, supporting all my crazy ideas, and accepting Ryan as your own. We're so lucky to have family nearby and we just love you both so much and can't wait to celebrate our (second) wedding with you. :"/sorkinfam1.jpg","/sorkinfam2.jpeg", "/SorkinFam3.jpg", "/SorkinFam4.jpg"
KennyFam:Mom, to start thank you for everything it took to get me to where I (Ryan) am today. You deserve so much credit for the person I have become (you can take that as either a compliment or insult lol). Asides from raising me you also have embraced Brenna as a member of the family, and the two of us are so lucky to have that level of support from you. We love you and cant wait to celebrate with you!:"/ellen1.jpg", "/KennyFam1.jpg",  "/KennyFam2.jpg", "/ellen2.jpg"
Zas:We're so excited to celebrate with you! Meeting you in Generate (Brenna would like to note it was actually OOD for her) was such a lucky moment in our lives. We have the best memories with you, from the Sherm to your roof, to Nola, to Nola again, to a lot of good meals around town. We're so glad you're part of our wedding party, we love you so much, and no, you cannot get on aux:"/Zas1.jpg", "/Zas2.jpg", "/Zas3.jpg", "/Zas4.jpg", "/Zas5.jpg",  "/Zas6.jpg"
MelAndMarc:You truly know us as a couple unlike anyone else does. Living with you was an incredible 3 (ahem, 5 -Brenna) years full of so much laughter, dance parties, drinking/tanning in the park, long walks, and getting so drunk that the hangover would keep one of us in the nest for a full 18 hours. You are so unbelievably special to us, and even tho you told Brenna not to date Ryan and she did anyways, we couldn't imagine having lived with anyone else. We're so excited you're moving closer to us again and we can't wait to watch Mamma Mia soon (Ryan would like to express durress at this sentence). Love you Mel!! Marc, we're so excited to get to know you better and we're so happy you and Mel found your way back to each other! Can't wait to celebrate with you!:"/Mel1.jpg", "/Mel2.jpg", "/Mel3.jpg", "/Mel4.jpg", "/Mel5.jpg", "/Mel6.jpg", "/Mel7.jpg"
JohnsonFam:We are so excited to celebrate our wedding with the both you! Theo, we are honored that you agreed to be our officiant and technically this whole event is credited to you as the one who introduced us (although getting Brenna's photo for the Tech Stars event led to a rocky start). But more than that, you've been a mentor and a friend to the both of us in the years since. Ariella, its been such a pleasure having our relationship with Theo grow to include you (and the kids). We can't wait to have you be a part of our special day!:"/JohnsonFam1.jpg", "/JohnsonFam2.jpg"
CK:Casey we are so excited to have you come to our (second) wedding. I (Ryan) know you already think of Brenna as a sister (and legally she's already your in-law) but its makes me so happy that you accepted her into our (crazy) family. I know Brenna is also so happy to have you as a Bridesmaid. Cant wait to celebrate with you!:"/ck_sk1.jpg","/ck_sk2.jpg", "/KennyFam2.jpg", "/ck1.jpg", "/ck2.jpg", "/ck3.jpg"
SK:Sean we are so excited to have you come to our (second) wedding. I (Ryan) know you already think of Brenna as a sister (and legally she's already your in-law) but its makes me so happy that you accepted her into our (crazy) family. It'll be a blast having you as a Groomsman!:"/ck_sk1.jpg","/ck_sk2.jpg", "/KennyFam2.jpg", "/sk1.jpg", "/sk2.jpg"
BandTricia:Brendan, you've been like a brother to Ryan for as long as he can remember! And Tricia, Ryan is so glad he got to get to know you outside the halls of Immaculata. We sincerly want to thank you for popularizing the ideas of having two weddings, and cant wait to have you come celebrate #2:"/BandTricia1.jpg", "/BandTricia2.jpg", "/BandTricia3.jpg", "/BandTricia4.jpg", "/BandTricia5.jpg"
TheMiyanis:You 2 truly are our "couple friends" and we love how much time we get to spend with you. Our weekly sleepovers (lol) during the pandemic are some of our favorite memories, and officiating your wedding was an incredibly special moment for us. As you know, we may never have gotten our shit together to date if not for the 2 of you. We love you both so much and can't wait to be in the same neighborhood!!:"/louandsim2.jpg","/louandsim4.jpeg","/louandsim5.jpg","/louandsim6.jpeg", "/TheMiyanis1.jpg", "/TheMiyanis2.jpg", "/TheMiyanis3.jpg"
ChrisAndHayley:The universe magic that brought Hayley and Brenna back into each others lives is somehow only one small part of the blessing that is having the 2 of you in our lives. Being neighbors has been so incredible, and we can't imagine our lives without you guys, even tho it's really only been a few years of actually knowing each other. You are 2 of the kindest, most thoughtful people, and we truly cherish our movie nights, even tho it will take us literal years to get through Harry Potter.:"/ChrisAndHayley1.jpg", "/ChrisAndHayley2.jpg", "/ChrisAndHayley3.jpg", "/ChrisAndHayley4.jpg", "/ChrisAndHayley5.jpg"
Carly:You are such a special part of our lives! It is such a joy every time we get to see you, and some of our favorite memories from college are with you - from chaos in the DR, to chaos in New Orleans, to chaos.. generally. It is so so so fun that we (Brenna, obviously) get to work together in 2 jobs now!! and we get to shit talk on the side all the time. We love ya:"/Carly1.jpg", "/Carly2.jpg", "/Carly3.jpg", "/Carly4.jpg"
ShaunAndJenny:Shaun, you were one of my (Brenna) first real friends at Northeastern, and have made such a big impact on my life. I remember making pasta in my basement apartment, and you..wearing my clothes...? for some reason...? And then when you and Jenny started dating it just made so much sense, and we both love spending time with you 2 and whatever dog is currently in your posession. You're 2 of our favorite people and time spent with you is always the most fun time. We're sad you're moving away, but excited for this next chapter for you and can't wait to visit! Also PSA Jenny, my mom will probably harass you at the wedding:"/ShaunAndJenny1.jpg", "/shaunjenny4","/shaunjenny3.jpg","/shaunjenny7.jpg"
ErykAndKen:It is so special that we (Brenna) met almost 15 years ago on the shores of Spy Pond and have stayed so close over the years. You've truly seen me through every phase of life, and I love that you and Ryan have gotten to know each other as well. Also we're so glad we got to meet Ken and are excited to spend more time together!! :"/ErykAndKen1.jpg", "/ErykAndKen2.jpg",  "/ErykAndKen3.jpg", "/ErykAndKen4.jpg"
Darc:Darcy, we are so so excited to celebrate with you! You've seen our relationship from the very beginning, as far back as drunkenly interrogating Ryan at the bar when we barely knew each other. You've been such a special person in my life for 15+ years (Brenna, obviously) but more than that it's how our friendship has grown up with us, and how I know it'll last forever.:"/BD1.jpg", "/BD2.jpg", "/biggroup1.jpg",  "/BD3.jpg", "/Darc1.jpg"
FerranteFam:You've been a second family to Brenna for most of my life, and many of my best and earliest moments involve you guys! Thank you for hazing Ryan with whiskey at the feast of 7 fishes a few years ago and embracing him as part of the family. We can't wait to celebrate with you!:
LizzieAndWill:Lizzie, you've been such an important part of Brenna's life since Kindergarten, from biking to TCBY, to Harvey Saskatoon, to you reading Dune and then escaping from our apartment. You bring so much joy to our lives, and time spent with you is always the best kind of adventure. Will, we've loved getting to know you over the past few years, and can't wait for more! :"/lizziewill2.jpeg","/lizziewill3.jpg","/lizziewill6.jpg", "/LizzieAndWill1.jpg", "/LizzieAndWill2.jpg"
GokalsSanghi:It's been so much fun getting to spend a lot more time with you in recent years! Krish has been there for so many fun times with Ryan in college, and Brenna has found it so special to bond with Megha since you both moved back to Boston. We love hanging out with you guys and your fur babies and your human baby, whether it's BBQs in our backyard dirt pit, or you teaching us to dance for Louis & Simi's wedding, or just generally spending time together. We can't wait to celebrate with you!:"/GokalsSanghi1.jpg", "/GokalsSanghi2.jpg", "/GokalsSanghi3.jpg"
BarryAndPaul:We've had so much fun visiting you both in NYC over the years, and you've truly embraced Ryan as part of the family. We love when we get to see you and go out to dinner together and catch up, not to mention when you're able to visit, which Atticus also loves. You guys always make us smile, and time spent with you is the best time. We're so excited to celebrate with you for a second time -- and also Barry's birthday!:"/BarryAndPaul1.jpg"
KofmanFam:We can't wait to celebrate with you all again! We're so lucky to have family nearby who we love spending time with, whether its the Sunday after Thanksgiving, Rosh Hashanah, or just because.:
JoeAndMaria:We are so so so glad you 2 moved back to Boston because we've gotten to know you both so much better. It's amazing having family so close by and we've loved that you've truly become our friends and such an important part of our lives. We're so excited to celebrate with you again and enjoy the summer as neighbors!:"/JoeAndMaria1.jpg", "/JoeAndMaria2.jpg", "/JoeAndMaria3.jpg", "/JoeAndMaria4.jpg",  "/JoeAndMaria5.jpg"
LynchFam:Mike and Patty, you were always like a second set of parents to Ryan and our special day would not be the same without you two being there. We cant wait to celebrate our wedding with you (a second time)!:"/mike_ryan_oyster.jpg"
Beth:Beth, we hope you're ready for round 2 of this wedding! You've been such a great friend to Ryan's family and so welcoming to the both of us. We are beyond excited to have you be there to celebrate our (second) special day!:
BeckiAndNolan:Becki, you've been such an amazing friend to Brenna for 20 years now. We had so many adventures from Running Brook, to Aspen, to KP, to now being real life, adult friends. You are such a steady guiding force full of wisom, and also the most fun person to be around. Nolan, we're so glad we've been able to get to know you, and we can't wait to continue spending time with you! We're so excited to celebrate with you both in September:"/biggroup1.jpg", "/Becki1.jpg", "/Becki2.jpg", "/Becki3.jpg", "/Becki4.jpg",  "/Becki5.jpg"
BeanieAndBasia:Beanie, you have been a constant presence in my (Brenna) life since I was a literal baby, and you've been such a force in shaping the person I am today. You are endlessly kind, funny, and just simply the best. I love that we get to talk every single day and share every detail of our lives. You heard about my crush on Ryan for literal years before anything happened, and you always rooted for us and have fully embraced Ryan and we both consider you so so important to us. Basia, we are so lucky that Beanie met and married you! You are truly part of our family too, and Ryan is so glad to have someone to complain about the Art Girls with. It's rare for 2 best friends to truly love each others spouses too and we feel like we have that with the 2 of you. We're sad you live on the other side of the country, but we know we'll be close for the rest of our lives no matter what.:"/BD1.jpg", "/BD2.jpg", "/BeanieAndBasia1.jpg", "/biggroup1.jpg", "/BeanieAndBasia2.jpg", "/BD3.jpg", "/BeanieAndBasia3.jpg", "/Bean1.jpg"
CaraAndAlyssa:Cara, you've known me (Brenna) for 20+ years at this point, and we've managed to stay friends through it all. I love that we're held together not only by our parents, but that we've truly created a friendship where even tho we live in different cities, when we see each other it's insanely easy to pick our friendship back up like no time has passed at all. Alyssa, despite only meeting a few times, it's so lovely to know you and spend time with you, and we really hope we can visit again soon. We're so excited to celebrate with you both! :"/CaraAndAlyssa1.jpg", "/biggroup1.jpg"
LaportaFam:Cathy and Larry, were so excited to celebrate with you! You've been great friends to Ryan's family and you have seen Ryan through all his life's milestones. We can't wait for you to join us on our special day :"/cathylarry1.jpg","/cathylarry2.jpg","/cathylarry3.jpg"
BerntFam:You guys have been family to me for as long as Brenna can remember, and we've spent so many holidays and celebrations together over the year. I can't imagine my life without you all in it, and you've seen me grow up, and now get married (again). You've truly made Ryan part of the family too, and we're so excited to celebrate with you in September!:
LaurenAndAlex:Lauren, despite only really knowing each other for a couple years, we bonded instantly. Sorry I freaked you out by saying I mate for life, but you've since become so important to me! Knowing both of you as a couple and being able to double date has been so fun, and we really feel like with you guys we're at the beginning of an amazing friendship, and we can't wait to spend more time together. Lauren, you're the only non-family member who saw our first wedding, and we can't wait to run it back and celebrate again!:"/AlexAndLauren1.jpg"
